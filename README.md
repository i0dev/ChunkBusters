# ChunkBusters Plugin!

This plugin allows you to place a block that will start breaking all the blocks within that chunk. 
It is useful for the factions gamemode.

This is a PLUGIN, and it goes into your `/plugins/` folder on your server. It will not work if It's elsewhere!

### How it works:

You can be given chunkbusters with the `/chunkbuster give <player> [amount]` command. Then the player can place it 
within their own territory or wilderness (configurable). Then it will begin breaking blocks within that chunk randomly.
